Greetings! 
This program consists of 3 files in which I learned and tested the workflow  
process, and 4 files in which I took parts from each and created a final  
model. The first code uses the SIFT algorithm to find key points and  
correspondences between two pairs of images (templates and references). It  
defines a function to find and visualize these correspondences using the  
OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries. The second code also utilizes the SIFT  
algorithm, but its main purpose is to remove the white background from the  
template and reference images before searching for correspondences. It  
then determines a homographic transformation to align the template with  
respect to the reference. The results are displayed using Matplotlib,  
including the display of the template and the aligned template. The third  
code employs the SIFT algorithm to search for key points and  
correspondences between two pairs of images (templates and references).  
Afterward, it determines a homography matrix for aligning the template in  
three-dimensional space. The results are displayed as three-dimensional  
graphics using the Matplotlib library, including the construction of a cuboid  
that represents the orientation and location of the template in space. Also,  
before the final program, I made some edits to the template_tea_cup_pad  
and created template_tea_cup_pad_2 to improve accuracy(but I used both  
files in the program). Finally, the last code involves the implementation of  
the SIFT algorithm to find key points and correspondences between  
templates and references in an image. Subsequently, it determines the  
homography matrix that describes the orientation and position of the  
template in three-dimensional space. The results are displayed in threedimensional graphics using the Matplotlib library, including the construction  
of a cuboid that visualizes the geometric information about the template in  
three-dimensional space.
